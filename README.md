# Runaway

~~This project is for deciding whether Elo of target player was boosted or not. First, the program analyzes recent matches and league matches(which mean all of the game in season) and saves the data to csv files. Then, calculates the similarity between these data using machine learning libraries or tools. If the match data of target player seem not to be uniform or to be drastically changed then we can judge this player has received Elo-boosting. There are some typical examples which can be adapted to this principle.~~

~~-The position of summoner spell has been changed a lot.(e.g., F flash to D flash, vice versa.)   ~~
~~-The position of active item(e.g., Stopwatch, Blade of the Ruined King, Youmuu's GhostBlade, Quicksilver Sash, Hextech Protobelt-01, etc.) has been changed highly.   ~~
~~-The player has won the game a lot with the champions not used frequently.  ~~

The project topic has changed.

The APIs we are using are: summoner, match, and league. We will maybe have a website too.
